🫀 Heart Disease Prediction
This project predicts whether a person has heart disease using machine learning. A Logistic Regression model is trained on medical data to classify patients as having heart disease or not.
The project follows a complete machine learning workflow: loading the dataset, splitting data into training and testing sets, training the model, making predictions, and evaluating performance.
The dataset used is the Heart Disease (UCI) dataset in CSV format, where the target column indicates the presence or absence of heart disease.
Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix. In medical diagnosis, recall is especially important because missing a disease case can be critical.
This project is suitable for beginners and demonstrates a simple, effective approach to binary classification in healthcare.
